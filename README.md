# Unit-Converter
Web app that can convert between different units of measurement.

## Web app created with Flask
For this project I decided to used Flask, a microframework of python for web-development because it's easier to use in small projects and easier to learn.

## How to run the code
First if you don't have Flask installed, you need to install it with `pip install flask`. 
Once done you just run `app.py` and copy paste the url of the web page on any browser.
Finally just use the converter as you like.
